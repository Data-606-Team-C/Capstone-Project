# Capstone-Project

Each group will have a team repository on GitHub. This repo will include all the codes, datasets, results, figures generated with proper explanations and well organized documentation https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/organizing-members-into-teams
• If the dataset (file size) is larger than 25 MB
• if the dataset it public, you can just include its link in your README file,
• else share the data with the instructor via cloud.
• Each team will have their website for their project (again on GitHub, please visit https://pages.github.com/). This site needs to include the title of the project, team members and roles, overview and aim of the project, information about the dataset(s), references, etc.
