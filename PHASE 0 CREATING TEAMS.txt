In the first two weeks of the semester
• Each student will introduce themselves and describe their major strengths (good at programming, creating dynamic web applications, machine learning algorithms, data management, creating visuals, project management, etc.)
• Then, the students will share their “capstone project ideas”. We will discuss what kind of skill sets would be necessary for successful completion of the project and we will try to create teams of 3 students based on the project’s difficulty, students’ strengths and interests. The ones who can’t find a team for themselves can be grouped by the instructor.
• Team creation and project selection should be completed at the end of the second week. Changes in groups and project ideas can be done in the following week.
• Note that the groups are free to choose the subject of their capstone project, but they need to get instructor’s approval before they start working on their project.
• Projects focusing on global challenges in areas such as climate, energy, natural resources, transportation, and healthcare are highly encouraged.
• Teams are also encouraged to submit the outcome of their work to data science journals and conferences. A successful example will be provided to the students. Notes
• Groups have to have either a research question which can be answered with data science or a new tool which uses data science to improve life. Exploratory data analyses are not accepted.
• Groups have to determine a dataset which is healthy and large enough. It is team members responsibility to make sure that they have the right dataset to carry out their project successfully. In the past, due to lack of an appropriate dataset, some students had to change their projects at the end of the first month or so and they eventually made less progress than expected.
• Datasets used in previous data science competitions (such as Kaggle) can be accepted, only if the target and analysis is different, or the datasets are supplemented with much more data sets that can add more predictive power.
• Once a group chooses a project pitch and dataset, they should contact the instructor as soon as possible for approval. The email should include a brief description of the idea (what is it about, which dataset will be used, how large dataset is, which methods are likely to be used, etc.)
• Groups, who cannot find a project idea, should contact the instructor as soon as possible. The instructor and other Data Science faculty might help with a list of possible projects and groups can align themselves with problem statements corresponding to their individual interests. Group members are encouraged to mention their strengths in data science and specific areas of their interest (i.e. healthcare, finance, sports analytics, etc.).
